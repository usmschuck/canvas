This is a simple plugin for Canvas-LMS, provides a basic structure for a plugin.

Canvas-LMS needs ruby 1.8.7 and up, but lower than 1.9, you will need rvm to get the older version of ruby.
Also needs Java JDK Runtime to be installed.
Recommended to do it on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS by the instructions, was done on 12.04 LTS.
Follow: https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms/wiki/Quick-Start

Plugins will be found on 'http://localhost:3000/plugins', you have to be logged in first.

The plugin ('ColoredDivTag') will be placed in:
canvas/vendor/plugins/colored_div_tag

Having inside:
init.rb 													//This gets ran by Canvas when the plugin is picked up.
lib/ 															//Contains the code for the plugin.
lib/colored_div_tag.rb						//This is the actual plugin code.
lib/colored_div_tag_register.rb		//This registers the plugin to be seen in the plugins list, to have the settings, and to be used.
app/															//A self contained 'app' folder just like in Canvas it self, contains further subfolders like models, views, controllers..
app/views													//Contains the template files (.erb), or folders to group templates, in this case there's plugin.
app/views/plugin/									//Contains template files.
app/views/plugin/_colored_div_tag_settings.html.erb		//This is the template for the way the settings are displayed.

The plugin just creates a div tag given the color and string from the settings, and places it where you call it.
To use the plugin, place '<%=raw color_tag("1") %>' in any of the canvas's .erb files. Originally done on canvas/app/view/assignments/_assignments_content.html.erb .
All the code is commented, aside from the _colored_div_tag_settings.html.erb
Also 'different ways.txt' shows this way (seems more right) and another way to make a plugin.

'Beginning Rails 3', page 287 shows that a plugin could be installed from github
